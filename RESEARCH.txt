Abstract
This paper explores a novel implementation path for enabling Rune-based fungible tokens to operate over the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Unlike Taproot Assets, which rely on an off-chain proof model and indexer infrastructure, the proposed Rune-Lightning design prioritizes full on-chain verifiability, trust-minimized off-chain settlement, and optional asset redemption using burn-based settlement channels. We present a high-level architecture, explore critical challenges (e.g., dust mitigation, off-chain state tracking, double-spend prevention), and propose a clean integration path leveraging LND (Go) and Rune client tools (Rust). This work contributes toward building a Bitcoin-native, resilient, and trust-aware token layer that extends beyond speculative use.

1. Introduction
Bitcoin’s UTXO model and decentralized consensus guarantee unmatched settlement assurances. However, Bitcoin's lack of a native tokenization standard has led to the rise of alternatives like Ethereum-based ERC‑20s, often compromising on decentralization, permanence, and verification.

Recent innovations like Taproot Assets and Runes aim to anchor fungible tokens directly into Bitcoin’s base layer. While Taproot Assets enable off-chain scalability and Lightning integration through cryptographic proofs, they rely on an external indexer ecosystem and lack full recoverability. In contrast, Runes are entirely on-chain, stateless, and require no auxiliary proofs—but do not yet support Lightning.

This research proposes a Rune-over-Lightning framework: a decentralized, Lightning-compatible mechanism for transacting Rune tokens with minimal trust and without proof dependencies.

2. Background
2.1 Runes Protocol
Runes are Bitcoin-native fungible tokens inscribed directly into transaction outputs using Bitcoin Script (OP_RETURN) with "Runestones" that encode issuance, transfers, and burns. They are:

On-chain only (stateless, immutable)

Fully recoverable (no indexer needed)

Trustless by design

Runes include a burn mechanism: transferring to an OP_RETURN output with an edict pointer can signal destruction.

2.2 Taproot Assets
Taproot Assets (TA) are off-chain token proofs anchored in Taproot outputs. They enable Lightning compatibility via LND-based channels but:

Rely on proof syncing with off-chain storage

Can be lost if proofs are not preserved

Require asset-aware channel funding and complex coordination

3. Core Design Philosophy
Our proposal builds on three principles:

Principle	Taproot Assets	Runes over Lightning (Proposed)
Verification	Off-chain + Anchor	On-chain only
Survivability	Needs live ecosystem	Survives as long as Bitcoin
Lightning Model	Native, but complex	Simpler, to-be-built
Redemption	Trust + Delegation	Trust-anchored via burn proof

4. Architecture Overview
4.1 Key Components
Rune UTXO Locking: Lock Rune-carrying UTXOs as part of Lightning channel funding.

Off-chain Rune Balances: Tracked by participant nodes within channels.

Burn-on-Close Model: Settlement triggers a burn to OP_RETURN, providing chain-native receipt for redemption.

Issuer Optionality: Asset issuer may offer fiat/asset redemption to a burn address via off-chain oracles, without requiring global on-chain settlement.

5. Technical Flow
5.1 Channel Opening
A user funds a Lightning channel with a Bitcoin UTXO that contains Runes.

A portion of the UTXO value represents the token balance.

Rune metadata (e.g., ticker, amount) is mapped and tracked off-chain between participants.

5.2 Off-Chain Transfers
Tokens move via balance updates in Lightning invoices.

Each participant tracks state, e.g.:

makefile
Copy
Edit
NodeA: +100 DOG
NodeB: -100 DOG
5.3 Channel Close + On-Chain Burn
If users want to settle on-chain:

They send the Rune off-chain to a predefined Lightning burn address.

This triggers a settlement output to an OP_RETURN with edict, signaling burn.

Users claim redemption with the burn tx proof.

6. Dust Mitigation Strategy
A major issue with on-chain settlement of tokens is dust explosion—where large numbers of small-value token outputs require Bitcoin UTXOs above the dust threshold (~546 sats).

Our Solution:
Fractional ownership off-chain: Minimize chain footprint.

Burn-and-redeem model: Burn 1000 DOG in a single transaction and allow fractional redemption by issuer without on-chain fragmentation.

Only settle to chain if necessary: The default state remains off-chain, reducing UTXO bloat.

7. Trust, Issuance & Redemption
Trust is always implicit when using fiat-backed assets like USDT or USDC. Even with fully on-chain tokens, the user must trust the issuer for redemption.

Our system preserves:

On-chain accountability via public burn transactions

Off-chain redemption flexibility (e.g., fiat transfer, BTC payment, asset swap)

This enables:

Non-chain redemption pathways (e.g., send Runes over Lightning → burn → receive USD in bank)

Low-friction user flows with verifiable proof

8. Implementation Stack
Layer	Language / Tool
Lightning Integration	Go (via LND)
Rune Parsing & Logic	Rust (via ord and custom tools)
Testing Environment	Docker, Regtest, LND
Future Extensions	TLV or Custom RPC in LND

9. Challenges & Future Work
State Sync: Ensuring consensus over off-chain Rune balances.

Atomic Burns: Preventing double-claim via burn replay.

Lightning Message Extension: Defining a BOLT or TLV to carry Rune transfer data.

Index-Free Claiming: Exploring stateless burn proofs for redemption.

Tooling: Developer SDKs, CLI tools, and testnet faucet integration.

10. Conclusion
Runes offer a uniquely Bitcoin-aligned approach to token issuance: permanent, minimal, and on-chain. By extending Runes to Lightning via a simple UTXO locking model and burn-on-close strategy, we unlock scalable payments, optional redemption, and proof-free asset survivability—without compromising Bitcoin’s ethos.

This approach is not only possible, but necessary if Bitcoin is to serve as the final layer of financial truth—tokens included.
